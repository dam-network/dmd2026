The University was officially founded by the Emperor Charles V in the year 1531, and built on a centuries-old teaching tradition dating back to the madrasahs of the Nasrid dynasty of Granada. Approximately 70,000 individuals – students, researchers, lecturers, and administrative and support staff – are directly linked to the UGR, making it the fourth largest university in Spain.\nThe main focus of this international conference is on current topics in Discrete Mathematics, including (but not limited to):\n\nCoding Theory and Cryptography.\nCombinatorial Number Theory.\nCombinatorics.\nDiscrete and Computational Geometry.\nDiscrete Optimization.\nGraph Theory.\nTheoretical Computer Science.\n\n\nImportant dates\n\nDeadline for submitting extended abstracts: 7 April 2026 (23:59 CET)\nCommunication of acceptance: 15 May 2026\nDeadline for submitting final versions of accepted contributions: 29 May 2026\nDeadline for early registration: 29 May 2026\n\n\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRED2024-153572-T Red de Matemática Discreta y Algorítmica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacultad de Ciencias Universidad de Granada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstituto de MatemáticasUniversidad de Granada\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

The airport is 17 km from downtown. Correspondences between Granada and its airport can be done by taxi or bus. The cab fare is about 30-35€. There is a 3€ bus airport-downtown (line 245), with different stops. The nearest one to the Faculty of Sciences is the eighth stop, at “Avenida de la Constitución Hotel Cóndor”.\nVia Malaga airport. The bus company Alsa has a service connecting directly the airport of Málaga with the city of Granada. From this airport, there are frequent connections (approximately one per hour). For more information, please visit the Alsa website. Another available connection is through the bus station in Málaga, from where one can find buses leaving to Granada each hour. These buses arrive at the bus station in Granada, from where one can take a taxi to downtown (about 10€) or a city bus (lines SN2 or SN5) in order to arrive to the institute (see here for a map of the city buses in Granada).\nBy high-speed train. There are daily connections to and from Granada with Madrid and Barcelona. The train station in Granada is around five-minute walking distance from the Faculty of Sciences.\n\n\n\nAccommodation\nThe organization of this meeting has an agreement with Hotel Turia (4*).
